## Intro

centurion is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPCoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

## To Build

Build local LevelDB:
```
cd src/leveldb
make libleveldb.a libmemenv.a
cd ../..
```

Build Centurion:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Binaries are placed in same dir (build), tests are in src/tests.

Optional GUI and tests:
```
rm -f CMakeCache.txt ; # clear cached values
cmake .. -DBUILD_GUI=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF
```

Debug and release build types:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
